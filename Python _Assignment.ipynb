What is Python, and why is it popular?\n","   -  python is a high level, interpreted programming language developed by guido van rossum in 1991. It is known for it's simple and readable syntax, making it easy to learn & use.\n","\n","   Reason for it's popularity:\n","\n","   - Easy to read and write code\n","   - Supports multiple programming styles\n","   - Wide range of libraries and frameworks\n","   -Used in web development, data science, AI, and more\n","   - Strong community support.\n","\n","2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n","   - An interpreter is a program that reads and executes code line by line, In python, the interpreter translates the high level python code at runtime, which the computer can understand and execute.\n","\n","3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n","   - Predefined keywords also known as reserved words in python are special words that have a fixed meaning and purpose in the language. They are part of the python syntax and cannot be used as variables names, function names or identifiers.\n","\n","4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n","   - No, Keywords cannot be used as variable names in python. why, because keywods have predefined meanings and are part of the python language syntax. using them as variable names would confuse the interpreter  and cause errors.\n","\n","5. What is mutability in Python?\n","   - Mutability in python refers to whether or not objects value can be changed after it is created.\n","   - Types of objects:\n","      1. Mutable Objects - Can be changed after creation.\n","        - Example : list, dict, set.\n","\n","6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n","   - In python, the design and purpose of these two data types dertermine  their mutability:\n","   1. Lists are Mutable:\n","     - Lists are meant to store collections of items that may change over time.\n","     - You can add, remove, or change elements after the list is created.\n","\n","     - Lists store reference to objects and allows updates to those reference.\n","     \n","        2. Tuples are immutable:\n","         - Tuples are designed for fixed collections of items.\n","         - Once created, the contents cannot be changed- no adding removing or modifying.\n","         - Tuples are stored in a way that optimizes performance and ensures they don't change.\n","\n","7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n","   - Both '==' and 'is' are comparison operators, but they check different things:\n","   1. Equality Operator (==):\n","      - Checks if two values are equal in content.\n","      - Compares the data stored in the variables.\n","   2. Identity Operator (is):\n","      - Checks if two variables point to the same object in memory.\n","      - Compares the identity/address of the objects.\n","\n","8. What are logical operators in Python?\n","   - Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions and reture true or false based on the logic:\n","    - There are three type of Logical Operators:\n","      1. AND - Returns True if both conditions are true.\n","      2. OR - Returns True if at least one condition is true.\n","      3. NOT - Reverse the result (True become False and False become True).\n","\n","9. What is type casting in Python?\n","   - Type casting in python refers to the process of converting one data type into another. It allows you to change the type of a variable manually using built-in functions.\n","    - There are two type of type casting:\n","       1. Implicit Type casting.\n","       2. Explicit Type casting.\n","\n","     - Implicit Type Casting - Done automatically by python.\n","     - Explicit Type Casting - Done Manually by the programmer.\n","\n","10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","  - Implicit Type Casting:\n","     - Definition: Done automatically by python.\n","     - Control: No need to specify conversion.\n","     - Risk of data loss: Very low, safe conversions.\n","     - Use Case: when mixing types like int and float.\n","\n","   - Explicit Type Casting:\n","    - Definition - Done Manually by the programmer.\n","    - Control: You have to specify the type youb want to convert to.\n","    - Risk of Data Loss: May result in data loss if not done carefully.\n","    - Use case: When converting input or changing data types manually.\n","\n","11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n","    - Conditional satements are used to make decisions in a program. They allow the program to execute certain blocks of code based on specific conditions.\n","\n","12. How does the elif statement work?\n","    - The elif (short for else if) is used to check multiple conditions one by one after an initial if condition. it lets you add more choices to your decision making process.\n","    - Syntax:\n","       - If Condition1:\n","             # Code block 1\n","         elif Condition2:\n","              # Code block 2\n","         elif Condition3:\n","              # Code block 3\n","         else:\n","              # Code block if none of the above are true.\n","    - How it works:\n","      1. Python checks the if condition.\n","      2. If it's True, it runs that block and skip the rest.\n","      3. If not, it checks the elif conditions in order.\n","      4. If an elif is True, it runs that block and skip the rest.\n","      5. If none are True, it runs the else block if present.\n","\n","13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n","    - For Loop:\n","      - Use case: Used when the number of iterations is known.\n","      - Syntax Simplicity: More compact and easier for looping over sequences.\n","      - Condition Check: Automatically handles condition with sequence.\n","      - Commen Usage: Itrating over lists, strings, ranges etc.\n","\n","    - While loop:\n","      - Use case: Used when the number of iterations is Unknown.\n","      - Syntax Simplicity: May require more setup (intialization and conditiona).\n","      Condition Check: You must manually write the condition.\n","      - Commen Usage: Running code until a certain condition is fake.\n","\n","14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n","    - A while loop is better when youb don't know in advance how many times the loop will run, and you want the loop to continue until a specific condition is met.\n","     \n","     - Example Senario: User Login System:\n","       - Let's say you are building a simple login system where the user has unlimited attempts to enter the correct password until they get it write.\n","     - Example:\n","\n","       Correct_password = \"Deep123\"\n","       user_input = \"\"\n","       while user_input != Correct_password:\n","           user_input = input(\"Please enter your password: \")\n","\n","       print(\"access granted\")"],"metadata":{"id":"kDJzjjAUI1hF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Practical Questions\n","\n","1.
